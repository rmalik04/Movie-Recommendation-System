Date: 5/2/2023

This project uses Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and KNN classifiers from the Scikit-Learn Python
Library as well as the MovieLens 100k dataset to tune a model that can recommend movies for a user. The
bulk of the model building code can be found in the Jupyter Notebook named "Project B".
